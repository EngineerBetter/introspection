# Feedback

Feedback means different things in different contexts, so it's worth thinking about what sort is meant:

1. **Appreciation** - _you've been working really hard and we love you_
1. **Coaching** - _you can't expect to get everything right, maybe if you try..._
1. **Evaluation** - _you don't know Golang well enough to anchor a team_

## Giving Feedback

When continuously learning we open ourselves up to being wrong and being criticised all the time. We make ourselves vulnerable to our colleagues, and so we each have a duty of care to be kind.

Avoid the following:

* **You always/never** - these absolutes are unlikely to be true, and only a Sith deals in absolutes
* **You make me** - no, they don't: you are responsible for your own feelings and actions

We often see our own shortcomings as a result of circumstance, and the shortcomings of others as character traits. Be aware of this bias.

## Difficult Conversations

The following format is a handy tool for difficult conversations:

**I saw** you doing this, and **I believed** that, and **I felt this**

Start with what you saw/heard/read. This immediately exposes any misunderstandings of fact.

What was the conclusion you came to? Just because _you believed_ someone was being unreasonable doesn't mean that they were. Your interpretation of events is your own, and by focusing on your interpretation instead of making accusations you can help to avoid a confrontation.

How did it make you feel? Reasonable people will not begrudge you your emotions. It's important to stop and think what really constitutes as an emotion though, because as adults we are atrociously bad at identifying them.

|Feeling|Not A Feeling|
|---|---|
|Sad|I feel that curly braces are better on a new line|
|Happy|I feel that Golang is a much more productive language|
|Frustrated|I feel like you're not listening to me|

You'll notice that in the above table the right-hand column are all beliefs, masquerading as feelings to make them irrefutable by others.

## Receiving Feedback

Negative emotional reactions to feedback fall into the following three categories. If you catch yourself having a negative reaction, see if you can identify if any of these apply.

1. **Truth** - _I don't agree with the facts you're putting forward_
1. **Relationship** - _I don't think _you_ are allowed to say that to me, or I don't like how you're treating me_
1. **Identity** - _That's not who I am_

Don't look for what's _wrong_ about feedback, instead look for what's _different_. That's where the interesting stuff lies, and that's where you'll get to the bottom of misunderstandings and different interpretations.

Try to avoid changing the topic of conversation to "well yeah, but always commit commented code". If there's another issue that comes up, that's fine to discuss, but deal with one situation at a time.
